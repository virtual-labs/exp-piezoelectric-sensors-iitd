**POST EXPRIMENT QUIZ QUESTIONS**

1) Plot the voltage response in time domain in MS Excel.
2) Using Matlab convert the voltage response from time domain to
frequency domain and plot the graph.
3) Calculate the natural frequency of the beam from the frequency plot.
4) Calculate the damping ratio using half power band method.
5) Compare the experimental damping ratio with the value available in
literature.
